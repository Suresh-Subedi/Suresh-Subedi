### Welcome stranger, ðŸ‘‹

My interests are .net, react, typescript, electronics, low-level programming, high-level programming, no mid-level programming, binary operations and manipulations.
Lately I'm interested in retro-computing and emulation (ala toy cpu, chip-8).
I also revel in taking things apart (teardowns).
I also try to make things. Hopefully I'll succeed more in future.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react, mui, typescript<br/>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio website using c#, .NET, entity framework, mysql, react, typescript, MUI

### Adventures in programming
* Started learning react/typescript/MUI
* [Toy CPU simulator in javascript](https://suresh-subedi.github.io/toy-cpu-emulator/)
* VS Code extension to log in with google and edit posts in my website
* Chrome extension to add current url/webpage to a selected list of my website

### Adventures in electronics
* Reprogram hoverboard motherboard to control wheel rotation (stm-32/st-link)
* Reprogram monowheel motherboard to control leds, buzzer (stm-32/st-link)
* Interface 2009 mitsubishi colt steering wheel controls(swc), arduino pro and android tablet to control tablet with swc. Handling  press, double press and long press of 5 buttons with only 2 wires was quite challenging. Even dashboard display mode could be changed from swc (used mosfet for that).
* Ben Eater's videos are addicting.
