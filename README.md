### Welcome stranger, ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react, mui, typescript<br/>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio website using c#, .NET, entity framework, mysql, react, typescript, MUI

### Adventures in programming
* Started learning react/typescript/MUI
* Toy CPU simulator in javascript
* VS Code extension to log in with google and edit posts in my website

### Adventures in electronics
* Reprogram hoverboard motherboard to control wheel rotation (stm-32/st-link)
* Reprogram monowheel motherboard to control leds, buzzer (stm-32/st-link)
* Interface 2009 mitsubishi colt steering wheel controls(swc), arduino pro and android tablet to control tablet with swc. Handling  press, double press and long press of 5 buttons with only 2 wires was quite challenging. Even dashboard display mode could be changed from swc (used mosfet for that).
* Ben Eater's videos are addicting.
