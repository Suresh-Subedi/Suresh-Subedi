### Welcome stranger, ðŸ‘‹

My interests are .net, react, typescript, electronics (mainly digital), low-level programming, high-level programming, no mid-level programming, binary operations and manipulations.
Lately I'm interested in retro-computing and emulation (ala toy cpu, chip-8).
I also revel in taking things apart (teardowns).
I also try to make things. Hopefully I'll succeed more in future.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning odoo, XAML (MAUI/WPF/Avalonia), react, mui, typescript, <br/>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio website using c#, .NET, entity framework, mysql, react, typescript, MUI

### Adventures in programming
* Started learning react/typescript/MUI
* [Toy CPU simulator in javascript](https://suresh-subedi.github.io/toy-cpu-emulator/)
* VS Code extension to log in with google and edit posts in my website
* [Chrome extension](https://sureshsubedi.wordpress.com/2024/01/06/chrome-extension-to-add-current-website-webpage-to-a-list-in-ssubedi-com/) to add current url/webpage to a selected list (shopping/wish/reading/...) of my website

### Adventures in electronics
* Reprogram hoverboard motherboard to control wheel rotation (stm-32/st-link)
* Reprogram monowheel motherboard to control leds, buzzer (stm-32/st-link)
* [Interface 2009 mitsubishi colt steering wheel controls(swc), arduino pro and android tablet](https://sureshsubedi.wordpress.com/2022/03/08/adding-steering-wheel-controls-to-mitsubishi-colt-and-imars-10-1-android-tablet/) to control tablet with swc. Handling  press, double press and long press of 5 buttons with only 2 wires was quite challenging. Even dashboard display mode could be changed from swc (used mosfet for that). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7afJWoUpAwE
* Ben Eater's videos are addicting.

### Combination of programming and digital electronics
* Ported c++ driver for rds fm module to micropython
